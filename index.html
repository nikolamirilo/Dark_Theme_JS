                    hack and slash video game series developed and published by Capcom and created by Hideki Kamiya. The
                    series centers on the demon hunter Dante and his efforts to thwart various demon invasions of Earth.
                    Its gameplay consists of combat scenes in which the player must attempt to extend long chains of
                    attacks, avoiding damage and exhibiting stylized combat; this combat, along with time and the number
                    of items collected and used, are considered in grading the player's performance. Across the series,
                    new characters with unique skills are available.

                    The series alludes to Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. Hideki Kamiya created Devil May Cry after a
                    failed attempt to develop a Resident Evil; Kamiya wanted to create a game with more action features,
                    something which Capcom felt the series did not need. The games were directed by Hideaki Itsuno and
                    writer Bingo Morihashi. Capcom announced a new game, DmC: Devil May Cry (developed by Ninja Theory
                    and Capcom), during the 2010 Tokyo Game Show. A high-definition remastering of the three PlayStation
                    2 titles was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2012, and in 2018 for the PlayStation 4,
                    Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. The latest game is Devil May Cry 5, which was released on March 8,
                    2019.

                    The series has been successful; the main entries have sold several million copies and received
                    Capcom's Platinum Title award. The success of the video-game series has led to comic books,
                    novelizations, an animated series, guides, collectibles, publications, and a variety of action
                    figures. Critical response to the gameplay combos has been positive, although the games' narrative
                    was considered simple until the third installment.

                    The series begins two millennia before the first game with the demon Sparda, the Black Knight,
                    defeating Demon World ruler Mundus. Sparda stops Mundus from conquering the human world by sealing a
                    number of hellgates, sealing Temen-Ni-Gru (the last portal) with a ritual requiring his blood and
                    the aid of a powerful priestess. Sparda meets Eva, who gives birth to his twin sons Dante and
                    Vergil that have beef and fight till death in order to prove themselfs.

                    The plot begins with Devil May Cry 3, a year after Dante has a falling-out with Vergil.[13] A large
                    tower erupts from the ground near the shop, and Dante interprets it as a challenge from Vergil.[14]
                    Dante is defeated in Temen-Ni-Gru by Vergil, who takes his locket and leaves with Arkham. Dante's
                    dormant devil power revives him, and he resumes pursuing his brother. Vergil wants to use the
                    pendants their mother gave them in a ritual to create a portal to the Demon World. The battle is
                    joined by Lady, who wants to avenge her mother's death by Arkham; Arkham manipulated the three into
                    completing the ritual, which would allow him to acquire Sparda's sword: the Force Edge.[15][16]
                    Dante and Vergil defeat him, and resume battling each other. The portal begins to close, and Vergil
                    approaches it. Dante pleads with his brother not to go, but Vergil leaps into the Demon World before
                    the portal closes. Vergil is tested and encounters Mundus, his mother's killer. When Lady returns to
                    the human world, she coins the phrase "devil may cry"; Dante uses it for the shop.[17][18]

                    Dante is confronted in Devil May Cry by Trish, who reveals that Mundus is planning to return and
                    only a descendant of Sparda can defeat him.[19] He explores Mallet Island (where Mundus is set to
                    return), encountering demons which include Mundus' general:[20] the undead Vergil, Nelo Angelo.[21]
                    As Dante approaches Mundus, he falls into a trap which reveals that Trish is the demon's agent; he
                    saves her, however, because she resembles his mother. Trish saves Dante from Mundus, and Dante
                    realizes his father's power.[22] Dante defeats Mundus when Trish helps him return Mundus to the
                    Demon World.[23] Dante and Trish escape as the island collapses, and work together in the Devil
                    Never Cry shop.

                    In the Devil May Cry: The Animated Series anime, Trish is a demon hunter; Dante is the bodyguard of
                    Patty, a young heiress who becomes obsessed with him. Patty's mother is descended from a sorcerer
                    who sealed the power of Abigail, an ancient devil lord. Patty is targeted by Sid, a demon seeking
                    Abigail's power. Lady and Trish fight demons summoned by Sid, and Dante kills him.

                    Dante is invited by Lucia in Devil May Cry 2 to meet her mother, Matier. Dante learns that Arius is
                    collecting artifacts (Arcana) to summon the demon lord Argosax.[24] Dante flips a coin, and decides
                    to help.[25] Lucia confronts Arius, who reveals that he created her.[26] Lucia gives Dante the last
                    of the Arcana before facing Arius alone.[27] Dante encounters Matier, who asks him to take the
                    Arcana to save Lucia from Arius.[28] Lucia attacks Arius, but he captures her. Dante arrives, trades
                    the Arcana for Lucia, and attacks Arius (who escapes).[29] A stream of energy strikes the Ouroboros
                    tower, and a portal to the demon world opens. Dante and Lucia argue about who will enter, and Dante
                    determines that he will go.[30] After Dante leaves, Arius returns to the human world and Lucia
                    defeats him.[31]

                    In Devil May Cry 4, Dante and Trish learn of foul play within the Order of the Sword and investigate
                    while learning of its religious leader's scheme to conquer the world using Vergil's sword Yamato.
                    Dante seemingly assassinates the Sanctus, only to face a young demon hunter acolyte named Nero who
                    awakened his own demonic powers as a descendant of Sparda. Nero goes on a quest to capture Dante
                    while gaining Yamato, only to learn the Order's dark secrets before being captured by Sanctus
                    through his girlfriend. Dante manages to cripple Sanctus's plans before freeing Nero to finish the
                    job, the two parting ways on good terms with Nero allowed to keep Yamato.

                    In Devil May Cry 5, set several years after Devil May Cry 4, Nero runs a mobile branch of Dante's
                    Devil May Cry business.[32] He befriends Nico, a weapons artist and descendant of the gunsmith who
                    crafted Dante's Ebony and Ivory handguns.[33] Nero's Devil Bringer arm from Devil May Cry 4 is
                    stolen; armed with a prosthetic Devil Breaker created by Nico, he leaves with Dante and the demon
                    hunter V to face their "strongest foe yet".[34][35]

                    Although the series' timeline had placed Devil May Cry 4 before Devil May Cry 2, it was retconned
                    with the release of Devil May Cry 5.[36][37] DmC: Devil May Cry, developed by Ninja Theory, is not
                    part of the timeline and takes place in an alternate universe from the main series. It moves away
                    from the gothic look of the previous games to a more contemporary setting with some social
                    commentary on mass media and culture[38]
